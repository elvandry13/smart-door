PinPin (Pintu Pintar) is an IoT based device that allows us to "communicate" with our door. There are two features of this device. First, we can find out the status of the condition of our door whether open or closed. Second, this device is equipped with an alarm that functions as a second layer of security. For example, it could be that a thief break the lock on our door. By activating this alarm, the alarm will turned on when the door opens as a warning sign of danger. We can activate it at night before we sleep, or when we want to go out of the house. All we can access control and monitor via our smartphone.
